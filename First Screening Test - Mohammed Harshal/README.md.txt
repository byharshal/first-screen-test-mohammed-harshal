First Screening Test - Mohammed Harshal

Tools Used
- Design Tool: Figma
- Font: Manrope
- Icons: Basicons

Approach
I recreated all 3 sections faithfully using a 1920x1080 frame for desktop and a 390x844 frame for mobile. I followed spacing, font sizes, and layout as closely as possible. I used auto-layouts in Figma to simulate responsiveness.

Notes
All designs are exported as PNGs and organized in folders.
